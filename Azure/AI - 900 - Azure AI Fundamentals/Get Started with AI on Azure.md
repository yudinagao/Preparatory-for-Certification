    - Azure Machine Learning 
        - cloud based platform 
        - creating, managing and publishing machine learning models
        - Automated machine Learning
            - Enable non-experts to quickly create and effective ML model from data
        - Azure Machine Learning Designer
            - Graphical Interface enabling no code  dev of ML solutions
        - Data and Compute management
            - cloud-based data storage and compute resources to run data experiment code at scale
        - Pipelines
            - define pipelines to orchestrate model training, deployment and management tasks
- Anomaly Detection
    - ML based technique that analyzes data over time and identifies unusual changes
    - Anomaly Detector service provides an API that devs can use to create anomaly detection solutions
    - Powerful inference engine
        - assesses time-series dataset and automatically selects the right detection algorithm to maximize accuracy
    - Automatic detection
        - eliminates the need for labeled trainign data to help you save time 
    - Customizable Settings
        - fine tune sensitivity 
- Computer Vision
    - Area of Ai that deals with visual processing
    - Seeing AI
        - Short text
        - Documents
        - Products
        - Person
        - Scene
        - Currency
        - Light
        - Color
        - Handwriting
    - Models and Capabilities   
    - Image Classification
            - classify images based on their contents
        - Object Classification
            - Classify individual objects within an image and identify their location with a bound box
        - Sematic Segmentation
            - advanced ML technique in which individual pixels in the image are classified according to the object to which they belong
        - Image Analysis
            - create solutions that combine ML models and image analysis techniques to extract information from images, including "tags" that could help catalog the image 
        - face detection, analysis and recognition
        - OPtical character recognition OCR
    - Computer Vision
    - Custom Vision
    - Face
    - Form recognizer

- Natural Language processing
    - NLP area of AI that deals with creating software that understands written and spoken language
        - analyze and interpret text in documents and email messagesand other sources
        - Interpret spoken language and synthesize speech responses
        - Automatically translate spokenor written phrases between languages
        - Interpret commands and determine appropriate actions
    - Services and capabilities
        - Language
            - understanding and analyzing text, training mL models that can understand spoken or text-based commands and building intelligent applications
        - Translator
            - more than 60 languages
        - Speech
            - Recognize and synthesize speech and traslate languages
        - Azure Bot
            - conversational AI
            - devs can use Bot Framework
- Knowledge Mining
    - describe solution that involve extracting information from large volumes of often unstructured data to create a searchable knowledge store
    - Azure Cognitive Search    

## Challenges and risks with AI

- Bias can affect results
    - model discriminates by gender due to bias in data with which it was trained
- Errors may cause harm
    - autonomous system failure causes an accident
- Data could be exposed
    - bot trained using sensitive data, which could be stored insecurely
- Solutions may not work for everyone
    - may not provide output for impaired users
- Users must trust a complex system
    - AI tool recommendations - based on
- Who's liable for AI-driven decision

## Responsible AI
Six principles
- Fairness
    - capabilities to interpret models and quantify the extent to whch features of the data influences the model prediction - help identify and mitigate bias in the model
- Realiability and Safety
    - must be subjected to rigorous testing and deplyment management processes to ensure that they work as expected
- Privacy and security
- Inclusiveness
- Transparency
- Accountability
