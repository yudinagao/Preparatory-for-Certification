# Preparatory for Certification
This repo is for all the preparation and notes for all the cloud and others services certifications.
So this is my idea: to concat all my notes and how I prep to the exams, like how I prepared to take the DP-900 from Microsoft Azure Data Fundamentals.

## MicrosOFt Exams and Virtual Training Days.
I found out recently that if you join Microsoft Azure Virtual Training Day , you may be eligible to take the exam for that specific content. 
I did the Microsoft Azure Virutal Training day Data Fundamentals Part I on the 25/10/2022 and the Part II on the 26th. It covered all the topics from their Data Fundamentals Learning Path for about 6 to 7 hours. Which is a lot. However if you studied previously, it should be just a review for you. After you attend the event, you may be eligible to gain a voucher which makes the exam free for you. You have 90 days to schedule your exam. 
You can see all the information in: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/trainingdays.

Tip: My english is not my mother language but it's quite good, so there was no problem to attend it in other timezones (like Singapore), but be sure to check the language before you apply to it. 

## The Microsoft Learn Cloud Skills Challenge 
I saw in LinkedIn couple of days ago that Microsoft offered a Cloud Skills Challenge and completing one granted you a specific free Microsft Certification exam.
Challenge Details: The challenge ends on November 9, 2022 at 4:00 PM (16:00) UTC. Make sure all modules in your challenge are complete before time runs out.â€¯ Your free Microsoft Certification exam offer will be delivered by November 18, 2022 and will expire on February 15, 2023.

You can view all the information in: https://www.microsoft.com/en-US/cloudskillschallenge/ignite/registration/2022

There are 7 learning Paths, which I have interest in the following three:
I - Microsoft Ignite: Intelligent Cloud Challenge - Learn the basic Azure concepts you'll need to know as an Azure infrastructure architect. Gain knowledge in IT operations, including networking, virtualization, identity, security, business continuity, disaster recovery, data platforms, and governance. 
II -  Microsoft Ignite: Cloud Developer Challenge - This challenge learning path will help you understand what DevOps is and how to plan for a DevOps transformation journey. 
III -  Microsoft Ignite: Protect Everything Challenge - Get familiar with attack vectors, cyberthreats, incident management, and Kusto Query Language (KQL). 

The first challenge grants you the AZ-305: Designing Microsoft Azure Infrastructure Solutions, the second grants you the Exam AZ-400: Designing and Implementing Microsoft DevOps Solutions and the last one is the Exam SC-200: Microsoft Security Operations Analyst.
